# Advanced SQL Puzzles
### Welcome to the GitHub repository. Here you will find numerous SQL puzzles to test your level of SQL knowledge. I hope you enjoy solving these puzzles as much as I have enjoyed creating them.

You can also interact with my puzzles by visiting my blog at https://advancedsqlpuzzles.com

All solutions are written in T-SQL, but can be easily modified to fit your flavor of SQL.

I also have quite a few tips, tricks and learning materials available if you scroll through my blog. I try to keep things to the advanced level and not recreate the already abundant amount of SQL resource materials available.

Feel free to contact me with any new puzzles that would be a great for my blog.
