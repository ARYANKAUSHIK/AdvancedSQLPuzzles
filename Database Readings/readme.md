# Database Readings

Here is my collection of various database writings in PDF format from various authors and industry leaders.  These writings provide a great foundations for learning RDBMS systems.

At the heart of these writings is E.F. Codd’s 1990 book, “The Relational Model for Database Management: Version 2”.  I had to divide E.F Codd's book into 3 PDFs for size constraints.  All these PDFs are available online if you perform an internet search.

Mr. Codd is the inventor of the Relational Model and quickly became the de facto standard for database management systems. Mr. Codd first established the Relational Model in 1970, and twenty years later he further articulates his model with this seminal work. It’s a bit lengthy at 567 pages, but worth the time to read.

I’ve also included “Architect of a Database System” which provides a high-level view of how RDBMS systems work. Written by academics Joseph M. Hellerstein, Michael Stonebraker and James Hamilton in 2007; this work presents an architectural discussion of DBMS design principles and system design techniques.

Lastly, I’ve included “Readings in Database Systems” which is a compilation of papers that explore DBMS applications which were first published in the now classic “Red Book” in 1988. Dr. Stonebraker and Dr. Hellerstein have selected a spectrum of papers on the roots of the field, which include classic papers from the ’70’s on the relational model to timely discourses on future directions.

I’m always collecting historical writings on database systems. If you know of any that are worth including, please let me know!
