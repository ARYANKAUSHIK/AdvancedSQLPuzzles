Birthday Problem

Last Updated: 07/07/2022

This script is written in SQL Server's T-SQL


• Relational division is used to divide the #Birthday table and determine nearest matches
• A non-equi self join is used to match birthdays
• 50% is reached around the 23rd/24th person, 100% is reached around the 90th person
• #BirthDaysHistory is not guaranteed to have each day, only days where there was a match
• #BirthDaysHistory will never have day 1 as a match can never occur on this day
• I have added the code to flash fill any missing dates at the end
