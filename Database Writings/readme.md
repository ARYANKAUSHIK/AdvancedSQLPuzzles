# Database Writings

----

In this repository you will find my musing and writings on various database topics.

#### Advanced SQL Joins
A great document that covers advanced join theory topics. Itâ€™s a great resource to learn the inner working of SQL joins.

----

#### Behavior of Nulls
NULL markers are a great source of frustration, so I decided to write a whole document about how the various SQL constructs treat the NULL marker.

----

#### Database Concepts and Components
Here I have collected all the different database concepts, components, and aspects into one
document; formatted into a list of questions with a link to an online resource (which is mostly the Wikipedia article on the subject) covering the subject.
